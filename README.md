# Doubly linked list
#### Simple .NET app that serves as a playground for learning unit testing and CT/CD via GitHub Actions

### Build
To build the app use ```dotnet-build``` command (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build).
Example (when in the solution root): ```dotnet build ./LinkedList.sln```

### Run tests
To run the tests project, simply go to the solution folder and run ```dotnet test```

#### Variant
This task required me to calculate my variant. I'm 11th student in the group list, hence my variant is 1: doubly linked list.

#### Failed CI commit
The task required a link to a commit where CI tests failed. [Here it is](https://github.com/MatthewKirik/methodology_lab2/runs/6794434110?check_suite_focus=true).
